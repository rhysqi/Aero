# Aero - Voxel Engine for Windows
Aero is a low-level voxel engine built using Windows API for direct system interaction. 
Unlike a traditional game framework, it operates by directly calling system functions and bypassing higher-level libraries or runtimes. 
This approach gives developers more control over how the system resources are managed and utilized, providing a more "bare-metal" experience in voxel-based 3D rendering.
